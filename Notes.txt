Middle Ages of JavaScript
-------------------------

Primarily used to display alerts, validate inputs and animate navigation menus.

Only small, browser-in applications.

For a long time JavaScript had a bad reputation.

Somewhere from 1996 till 2000's there were a famous Browser Wars. 
Both Microsoft and Netscape foresaw the power of client side applications.

Second, JavaScript as language wasn’t taken seriously. After quick glance on syntax, you can clearly see similarities with C++ or Java, so impression was — “I know this language.. almost”. Blindly applying the knowledge learnt from other languages to JavaScript, without trying to understand it’s philosophy led to bad design and overall frustration.

And finally, there was almost no tools that made JavaScript development easy and pleasant. No good IDE’s, code analysis tools, debuggers and best practices. Since JavaScript primary job was DOM manipulation, unclear DOM interfaces and specs made it even worse.

Those three major factors combined in one, made anyone who tried to use JavaScript literally suffer. A lot of people hated JavaScript.
